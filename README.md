# Building-Regression-Tree
In this problem, a built in dataset of diabetes was used to develop the Regression Tree model. The hyperparameters were chosen to produce the lowest Root Mean Squared Error Value. Also some analysis was done to check for Multicollinearity and was removed to make the model more robust.
